  const aboutText = `In the grand theater of cinema, disaster movies are my guilty pleasure turned scholarly pursuit. Like a cinephile Nostradamus, I've set out to map the ebb and flow of our collective anxieties through the lens of Hollywood catastrophe.

  From rampaging monsters to climate calamities, each era's on-screen disasters mirror our societal fears with uncanny precision. By charting these cinematic cataclysms, I'm not just indulging my penchant for popcorn-fueled pandemonium â€“ I'm unearthing a timeline of cultural tremors.

  This project is my Rosetta Stone for decoding the zeitgeist, a seismograph of silver screen destruction that reveals the fault lines in our shared psyche. It's also my personal guide to cinematic Armageddon, ensuring I never miss a satisfying dose of meticulously orchestrated chaos.

  So join me as we dive into this data-driven disaster zone. Together, we'll unravel the threads of our apocalyptic obsessions, one mushroom cloud at a time. After all, in the world of disaster movies, the end is just the beginning of understanding.`;
